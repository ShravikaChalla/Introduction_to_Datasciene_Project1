# Overview:
The "Electric Vehicle Population Data" from the Washington State Department of Licensing provides insights into electric vehicle (EV) trends in Washington. This dataset lists EVs by their unique Vehicle Identification Numbers, and details where each vehicle is registered â€” by county, city, and postal code. It also gives specifics about the vehicle, such as its model year, brand, type, and electric range. Additional data includes the vehicle's retail price, its eligibility for clean fuel programs, and associated legislative district. By including details like the electric utility and 2020 Census Tract, the dataset allows for a deeper understanding of EV usage patterns and preferences in Washington.
